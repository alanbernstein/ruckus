@title[#:tag "prerequisites"]{Prerequisites}

To use Ruckus, you will need:

@itemlist[
  @item{A computer running Linux (preferably).}
  @item{A reasonably beefy GPU, ideally from Nvidia.}
  @item{A recent version of @hyperlink["https://racket-lang.org/"]{Racket} ---
        say, at least 6.0.}
  @item{The Ruckus source code.}
  @item{Some patience and willingness to experiment.}
]

@section{Operating System}

Ruckus is developed and tested on Linux.  It should also work on other
Unix-like operating systems, such as FreeBSD, but you may encounter
surprises.  @bold{I'd be interested in hearing about any problems you
encounter.}  With OpenGL no longer supported on Mac, Ruckus will likely 
not work without the assistance of a contributor with access to a Mac.

There's no clear technical reason why Ruckus wouldn't work on Microsoft
Windows, but:

@itemlist[
  @item{Ruckus is command-line driven, which may be difficult with Windows'
        weak command-line environment.}
  @item{Ruckus visualizers lean heavily on OpenGL, which has spotty support on
        Windows.}
]

If you want to give it a shot, go for it.  @bold{I'd be interested in any
@italic{fixes} you develop for Windows,} but I probably can't help develop
them.

@section{Graphics Card}

Ruckus uses your computer's GPU to accelerate certain operations.  The better
your GPU, the faster you'll get results.

Currently, best results come from Kepler or Maxwell architecture Nvidia GPUs
(say, GTX 650 and later) with recent driver versions.  You don't need a fancy
Quadro; they're actually slower for Ruckus than the mass-market cards of
similar age.

Intel HD Graphics built into Haswell and later laptops can be used in a pinch.
I do a fair amount of development and testing on a Lenovo T440s.

Older Intel graphics will prove quite frustrating; the Lenovo T430s is unusable.

@section{Racket}

Ruckus is written in Racket, a programming language from the Lisp family.
Because Ruckus is distributed in source form, you will need a copy of the
Racket tools to run it.

Ruckus is most heavily tested on Racket version 6.3, which is a recent but not
bleeding-edge version.

@bold{Ruckus is known not to work on Racket version 5.x}, the ancient version
currently (spring 2016) being distributed with the Ubuntu LTS.  You will need
to install Racket manually on such computers.

@section{Ruckus Source Code}

@subsection{Using the Package}

The easiest way to install Ruckus is from the Racket package system:

@exec{raco pkg install ruckus}

Note that this will install the Ruckus executables in a directory that is
probably not in your path, something like:

@margin-note{Note that this depends on your Racket version.  I don't know why
the Racket folks want us to edit our @exec{.profile} every time Racket's
version changes.}

@exec{~/.racket/6.3/bin/}

You will either need to add this to your @exec{PATH}, or manually type it in
front of every Ruckus command.

@subsection{The Hard Way}

Alternatively, you can obtain the source code directly from the
@hyperlink["https://github.com/cbiffle/ruckus"]{Ruckus GitHub repository}.

Once you have a copy of the source code, change into the directory and run

@exec{raco pkg install}

The same warning about the executables not being in your path (above) applies
to manual installations.
